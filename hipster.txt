UCS requires the following access permissions:

Read permission for the Environment tenant and any other tenants configured in the UCS application.
Full Control permission to the Category Structure and Screening Rules business attributes.
To prevent overwriting of object permissions, you must apply permissions to higher-level objects first (for example, at the tenant level) before applying permissions to lower-level objects.

Open Configuration Manager and refer to the steps below for more information.
